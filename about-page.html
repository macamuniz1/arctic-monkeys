            Nick O'Malley
          </h2>
          <p>
            O'Malley was drafted in as a temporary replacement for bassist Andy Nicholson when the latter announced he would not make the band's North America tour in May 2006,[2] while working at Asda.[3] O'Malley says that he learned the whole of the band's debut album in two days of intensive play where he "pretty much didn't even leave the house".[4] His first recordings with the band were on their non-album single "Leave Before the Lights Come On", in which he played bass guitar.
